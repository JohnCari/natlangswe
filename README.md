> A Natural Language Software Developer — Best practices for AI-assisted development to prevent vibe coding

## What is NatLangDev?

**NatLangDev** stands for **Natural Language Software Developer** — a discipline for writing software through structured communication with AI coding assistants.

Natural Language Software Development is the practice of directing AI assistants like Claude Code using explicit, well-defined guidelines rather than ad-hoc prompts. This repository teaches the best practices for this emerging development paradigm.

## Why NatLangDev?

### The Problem: Vibe Coding

"Vibe coding" happens when developers prompt AI assistants without clear constraints or standards, resulting in:

- Inconsistent code quality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Poor architectural decisions
- Code that "works" but violates best practices
- Technical debt that compounds with each generation

### The Solution: Structured Natural Language Development

Instead of vague prompts like *"write me a web server"*, Natural Language Software Development provides explicit rules that AI assistants follow. By adding these guidelines to your AI's context, you get code that adheres to proven standards — whether that's NASA's safety-critical rules, idiomatic language patterns, or framework-specific conventions.

## How to Use

1. **Choose your guidelines** — Select the language, framework, and pattern guidelines relevant to your project
2. **Add to AI context** — Include the guideline files in your AI assistant's context (e.g., via CLAUDE.md, system prompts, or project files)
3. **Develop with structure** — Your AI assistant will now follow these best practices in all generated code

### Example

To use Rust guidelines with Claude Code, add to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
Follow the guidelines in:
- /path/to/NatLangDev/languages/rust/POWER_OF_10.md
- /path/to/NatLangDev/patterns/MINIMAL_DEPENDENCIES.md
```
