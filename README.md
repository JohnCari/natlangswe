> Coding in "Natural Language" — Prevent vibe coding with structured AI prompts

## What is NatLangDev?

**NatLangDev** (Natural Language Developer Guide) is a collection of curated guidelines that help developers communicate effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude Code.

### The Problem: Vibe Coding

"Vibe coding" happens when developers prompt AI assistants without clear constraints or standards, resulting in:
- Inconsistent code quality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Poor architectural decisions
- Code that "works" but violates best practices

### The Solution: Structured Guidelines

Instead of vague prompts like *"write me a web server"*, NatLangDev provides explicit rules that AI assistants follow. By adding these guidelines to your AI's context, you get code that adheres to proven standards — whether that's NASA's safety-critical rules, idiomatic language patterns, or framework-specific conventions.
